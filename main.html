  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of its input. 
    It helps us analyze how <b>efficient</b> an algorithm is when dealing with larger datasets. 
    The goal is to design algorithms that are both correct and efficient in terms of their running time.

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the total amount of memory an algorithm uses during execution. 
    It includes the memory required for variables, data structures, and function calls. 
    A good algorithm maintains a balance between time and memory usage. 
    For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) uses memory proportional to the input size.
